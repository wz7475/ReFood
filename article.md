#### RabbitMQ - reliable and efficient message broker

RabbitMQ is an advanced open-source message-broker software, renowned for its versatility in supporting a myriad of messaging protocols. Initially designed to implement the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), RabbitMQ has evolved with a flexible plug-in architecture, facilitating support for a wide range of other protocols such as the Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) and Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT).

**Implementing RabbitMQ with Docker**

-   **Pulling the Docker Image**: Begin by retrieving the RabbitMQ Docker image through the command `docker pull rabbitmq`.

-   **Running the RabbitMQ Container**: Launch the RabbitMQ Docker container using `docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3`. This command initializes a detached container with specific hostname and port configurations.

**RabbitMQ's Role in Asynchronous Communication within Distributed Systems**

In this project, RabbitMQ serves as the cornerstone for handling asynchronous communication, a critical aspect in the realm of distributed systems. This approach ensures that tasks are executed accurately and sequentially, while simultaneously not obstructing the workflow of the application. RabbitMQ effectively manages tasks that can be processed in the background, significantly enhancing the application's performance and user experience.

-   **Connection Establishment**: The `get_rabbitmq_connection` function within the `connectors` module plays a pivotal role in establishing a robust connection with RabbitMQ.

-   **Producer**: The `send_messages_from_outbox` function in the `backgroundtasks` module is creates and send messages to appropriate queues.

-   **Consumer** The `fulltext` service receives messages and does jobs described in thme

#### Elasticsearch - fast and powerful addition to your project

Elasticsearch gives you a fast engine for full text search and many other options, for example in our project we used it for searching objects using their geo location and the proximity radius.

**Technical overview**:

-   we found docker to be the main tool with using multiple modules so:
    -   have elasticsearch docker container
    -   have indexing container
-   use rabbit mq ques to communicate with indexing container
-   indexing container is creating new records in elasticsearch
-   communicate with elasticsearch container using native queries

**Technical tips for usage with python**:

-   we found using native elastic queries to be most effective and easy to develop, not using external interfaces for communication
-   use elasticsearch documentation as the main source of information

#### Eventual Consistency and the Outbox Pattern: Ensuring Data Harmony

Eventual consistency is a pivotal consistency model in distributed computing, designed to attain high availability. It guarantees that, ultimately, all accesses to a particular data item will reflect its most recent update, assuming no new modifications are made.

**Implementing the Outbox Pattern: A Detailed Procedure**

1. **Outbox Table Creation**: Initiate by setting up an "outbox" table in your database.

2. **Application Update**: Revise your application to simultaneously write events to the outbox table and update business data in a local transaction.

3. **Event Publishing Process**: Develop an additional process to extract events from the outbox and relay them to the message broker.

**The Outbox Pattern's Significance in Distributed Systems**

In this project, the Outbox Pattern is crucial for maintaining data consistency between the application's database and the message broker. This technique is especially beneficial in distributed systems to prevent data loss and inconsistencies arising from asynchronous operations. In our case it is synchronization of data from PostgreSQL to ElasticSearch.

-   **Data Representation**: The `Outbox` model in the `models` module symbolizes the outbox table.

-   **Event Handling**: The `send_messages_from_outbox` function in the `backgroundtasks` module is responsible for reading the outbox and transmitting messages to RabbitMQ.

#### Leveraging Background Tasks in FastAPI for Efficient Processing

FastAPI is a contemporary web framework for crafting APIs in Python 3.6+, lauded for its performance and reliance on standard Python type hints. Its intrinsic support for background tasks enables functions to run asynchronously, post-response, without affecting response time.

**Setting Up Background Tasks in FastAPI: An Instructional Guide**

1. **Function Definition**: Start by defining a specific function for the background task.

2. **Incorporating BackgroundTasks Parameter**: In your path operation function, include a `BackgroundTasks` parameter.

3. **Task Addition**: Utilize the `BackgroundTasks` object within your path operation function to append the background task for execution.

**Optimizing User Experience and efficiency with FastAPI Background Tasks**

In this project, FastAPI's background task are used to process the outbox table efficiently, ensuring that the user interface remains responsive. This allows the application to promptly respond to user requests while concurrently managing background processes. Such task is a trigger to process `Outbox` table instead of setting up process which polls table.

#### Creating a single page application with Vue.js and Vuetify as the perfect frontend for your application

Building a Single Page Application (SPA) in Vue.js and Vuetify offers numerous advantages that enhance the overall development process. Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework, combined with Vuetify, a material component framework, creates a powerful combination for creating modern and visually appealing SPAs.

One of the biggest advantages of building a SPA in Vue.js is the enhanced user experience. SPAs provide a smooth and seamless browsing experience as they load all necessary content upfront and subsequently update the page dynamically. This eliminates the constant page reloading experienced in traditional multipage applications.

Vue.js's reactive and component-based architecture also contributes to the development of highly modular and maintainable code. It allows developers to break down their application into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to manage and scale their projects. Vue.js's intuitive syntax further simplifies the development process, reducing the overall learning curve.

Vuetify further complements Vue.js by offering pre-designed Material Design components. These components provide consistent visual elements, ensuring a polished and professional user interface. With ready-to-use components like buttons, form elements, and navigation bars, developers can focus more on the core functionalities, saving time and effort.

Lastly, Vue.js and Vuetify are highly flexible and customizable. Developers can easily extend the framework's functionalities by adding plugins or creating new components tailored to their specific requirements. This flexibility ensures that developers have full control over the project and can adapt it to meet their unique needs.

In conclusion, building a SPA using Vue.js and Vuetify offers several advantages, including streamlined development, enhanced performance, visually appealing design, extensive community support, and flexibility. These factors contribute to a successful and efficient development experience, making Vue.js and Vuetify an excellent choice for building modern SPAs.
